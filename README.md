Kunstmaan Bundles CMS
=====================

## A bit of background

[Kunstmaan](http://www.kunstmaan.be) is a Leuven (Belgium) based communication agency. Since 1998 we have been helping brands make their mark with integrated communication. We combine state-of-the art production with strategic insight, creative imagination and powerful design. In doing so our technical teams focus on delivering high-tech solutions to bring these brands to the internet, and as such, building both campaign- and corporate websites as a core business.

## A spice of history

In the end of 2011 we were looking for a new way to build professional, fast, good looking websites. We did a lot of research on the programming language, licensing, quality and community and found our needs filled by the Symfony2 framework. Even though version 2 was just released as a stable release a few months earlier, the uptake in the PHP community was huge. It was a perfect fit for us.

Seeing that Symfony2 is a framework, there was no off the shelve CMS system available at that time. So, using the framework itself, and a lot of community bundles we started building our new content management system.

We started by developing out an extensive core feature set:

* a user friendly administration interface
* an administration interface that also looks great
* fully multilingual, from the core on up
* a versioning system for content
* a role-based permission system
* full support for all kinds of SEO and Social metadata
* a built in search engine
* an extensive media management system
* and last but not least, our very useful pagepart based page compositing system

We also developed the entire system while keeping in mind that we wanted to use as much community bundles as possible, and that we wanted to opensource our CMS, and in this way both benefitting and giving back to the community. The goal was to lower total cost of ownership for us, as well as our customers.

In the end, producing this content management system. If you want to take a peek at what we did wit it, [check out some project showcases at the website](http://bundles.kunstmaan.be/showcase).
