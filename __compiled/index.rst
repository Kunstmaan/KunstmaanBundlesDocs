A bit of background
-------------------

`Kunstmaan <http://www.kunstmaan.be>`__ is a Leuven (Belgium) based
communication agency. Since 1998 we have been helping brands make their
mark with integrated communication. We combine state-of-the art
production with strategic insight, creative imagination and powerful
design. In doing so our technical teams focus on delivering high-tech
solutions to bring these brands to the internet, and as such, building
both campaign- and corporate websites as a core business.

A spice of history
------------------

In the end of 2011 we were looking for a new way to build professional,
fast, good looking websites. We did a lot of research on the programming
language, licensing, quality and community and found our needs filled by
the `Symfony2 framework <http://symfony.com>`__. Even though version 2
was just released as a stable release a few months earlier, the uptake
in the PHP community was huge. It was a perfect fit for us.

Seeing that Symfony2 is a framework, there was no off-the-shelf CMS
system available at that time. So, using the framework itself, and a lot
of community bundles we started building our new content management
system.

We started by developing out an extensive core feature set:

-  a user friendly administration interface
-  an administration interface that also looks great
-  fully multilingual, from the core on up
-  a versioning system for content
-  a role-based permission system
-  full support for all kinds of SEO and Social metadata
-  a built in search engine
-  an extensive media management system
-  and last but not least, our very useful pagepart based page
   compositing system

We also developed the entire system while keeping in mind that we wanted
to use as much community bundles as possible, and that we wanted to
opensource our CMS, and in this way both benefitting and giving back to
the community. The goal was to lower total cost of ownership for us, as
well as our customers.

In the end, producing this content management system. If you want to
take a peek at what we did wit it, `check out some project showcases at
the website <http://bundles.kunstmaan.be/showcase>`__.

A dash of documentation
-----------------------

While very user friendly for the maintainers of the CMS content, we feel that a manual describing the basic functionality of the administration interface is a great way to get people up to speed very quickly. If you are a maintainer, please check out the end user section of this documentation.
