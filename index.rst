A dash of documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While very user friendly for the maintainers of the CMS content, we feel that a manual describing the basic functionality of the administration interface is a great way to get people up to speed very quickly. If you are a maintainer, please check out the end user section of this documentation.

As a developer wanting to get your own website up and running using the Bundles CMS a bit of documentation is very welcome. The developer section will answer most of the common questions and will help you get up and running as quickly as possible.
